# tolian

This repository serves as a miscellaneous collection of scripts and temporary tools, functioning as a sandbox for quick prototypes, experiments, and drafts. It is designed for exploration and testing ideas that may evolve into more structured projects later. This is not intended to be a polished library but rather a flexible workspace for learning, experimentation, and rapid development in Kotlin.

## Features

- **Prototyping Space**: Quick implementations of basic Kotlin concepts, including loops, conditionals, classes, and extension functions.
- **Experimental Code**: Examples for string manipulation, user input handling, and simple data structures.
- **Sandbox Environment**: Ideal for testing ideas without the constraints of production-ready code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17 or later
- Gradle (wrapper included)

### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd KotlinBasics
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Run a specific main class (e.g., Main.kt):
   ```sh
   ./gradlew run --args="MainKt"
   ```

   Replace `MainKt` with the appropriate class name for other files like `Main2Kt` or `Main3Kt`.

## Project Structure

- kotlin: Contains Kotlin source files with examples and experiments.
  - Main.kt: Basic loops, variables, and user input.
  - Main2.kt: Conditionals, lists, and more input handling.
  - Main3.kt: Classes, extension functions, and string reversal.
- build.gradle.kts: Gradle build configuration.
- settings.gradle.kts: Project settings.

## Usage

This project is for educational and experimental purposes. Feel free to modify, extend, or use the code snippets as starting points for your own projects. Note that the code is not optimized for production and may include intentional simplifications for learning.

## Contributing

As this is a sandbox, contributions are welcome for adding new experiments or improving existing drafts. Please ensure any additions align with the exploratory nature of the project.
